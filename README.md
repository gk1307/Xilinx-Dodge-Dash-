# Xilinx-Dodge-Dash-
Game chip emulated on a reconfigurable FPGA chip

-Rules-
Dodge Dash is a cross game between Tetris and Pac-Man on a FPGA board 
A different kind of blocks would fall down from the top of the FPGA board and
the user would have to avoid the blocks and at the same time 'eat' the blocks
that are blinking to score 1 point. The game is over if the user gets hit three
times.
